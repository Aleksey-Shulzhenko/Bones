Dice game C++ SFML

## Description

I was tasked with developing a GUI dice game.   The main task was to create a functional game that would allow the user to play dice and display the results.  The game was made in the C++ language with an additional SFML library.

## Technical instructions 
 - `#include <SFML/Graphis.hpp>`: A library for outputting a graphic image.
 - `#include <SFML/Audio.hpp>`: A library for outputting audio files when opening the program.
 - `#include <iostream>`: Gives access to the std:: namespace and text output.
 - `#include <clocale>`: Gives access to Cyrillic languages.
 - `#include <ctime>`: Serves as a random number sensor.
 - `#include <stdio.h>`: C language library, used program delay.
 - `#include <Windows.h>`: program delay for a specific time.
 - `#include <fstream>`: Library for working with files.
 - `#include <sstream>`: Work with data streams.
 - `#include <vector>`: Data management in dynamic changes.

## Requirements
1. Programming language: C++.
2. Development environment (IDE): Visual Studio 2022 Preview.
3. Game type: Graphic application.
4. Additional library: SFML
